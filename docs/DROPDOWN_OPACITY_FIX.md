# Dropdown Background Opacity Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The sign-in/registration dropdown and user menu dropdown had low background opacity (`bg-white/20 dark:bg-white/10`), making the text difficult to read and understand.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **Increased Background Opacity**

#### **Before:**
```css
bg-white/20 dark:bg-white/10
```

#### **After:**
```css
bg-white/40 dark:bg-white/30
```

## 📍 Fixed Components

### **1. Authenticated User Dropdown**
- **Location**: `src/components/layout/header.tsx` (line 178)
- **Context**: User menu dropdown showing user name, role, and "Sign Out" option

### **2. Mobile Authentication Dropdown**
